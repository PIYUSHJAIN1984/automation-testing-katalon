# Automation Testing Learning Lab: Katalon Studio

## 📌 Project Objective
This repository demonstrates automating test cases using **Katalon Studio** trial version. 
This involved exploring the platform's core automation features to determine its efficiency in handling end-to-end web testing flows.

## 🛠 Features & Capabilities Explored
During this implementation, I successfully utilized the following Katalon Studio features:
- **Web UI Automation:** Recorded and manually scripted user interactions on a System Under Test (SUT).
- **Object Spy & Recognition:** Managed dynamic web elements using the Object Repository with XPath and CSS selectors.
- **Data-Driven Testing (DDT):** Integrated external data sources to execute the same test logic with multiple variable sets.
- **Modular Test Design:** Created reusable **Custom Keywords** and **Test Listeners** to reduce script redundancy.
- **Smart Wait Functionality:** Implemented built-in wait mechanisms to handle asynchronous page loading and improve script stability.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Generated detailed execution reports to analyze pass/fail trends.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Verified application behavior on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

## 📂 Framework Structure
- `Test Cases/`: Categorized scripts based on functional modules (Login, Checkout, Profile).
- `Object Repository/`: Centralized storage for all UI elements for easier maintenance.
- `Test Suites/`: Bundled test cases for Smoke and Regression testing.
- `Scripts/`: Underlying Groovy scripts for advanced logic customization.

## 🚀 Execution Environment
- **Tool Version:** Katalon Studio [10.4.3] (Trial License)
- **Browser Compatibility:** Validated across Chrome and Firefox.
- **SUT:** Demo sites used
- **Language:** Groovy / Java

## 🚀 How to Run the Tests
1. Clone this repository: `git clone [Your-Repo-Link]`
2. Open **Katalon Studio**.
3. Go to **File > Open Project** and select this directory.
4. Open a Test Suite and click the **Run** button.

## 📊 Evaluation Results
This project served as a deep dive into the **Katalon Ecosystem**. I successfully demonstrated how a trial license can be used to build a robust foundation for automated testing, specifically focusing on script reusability and minimizing maintenance overhead through the use of an organized Object Repository.

Using trial license I have also completed **Katalon Practitioner Certification**
